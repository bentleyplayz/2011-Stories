  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 15 — PEACE FOR ALL (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    I wish peace for all, as it lays the groundwork for understanding and compassion. I wished that we could remove laws that unfairly label belief in magic as illegal, allowing everyone to embrace their unique perspectives without fear of persecution and then it was all over everywhere had peace no one could be thrown away because of their beliefs. <em>THE END</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 16 — DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    It was a normal day for me I already solved world peace. I thought there was nothing more for me to do. Suddenly Zack rings my doorbell. I opened the door and said “Hey Zack” and Zack replied, “Hey I need to talk to you… can I come in.” I replied “Sure I'm not doing anything right now.”  
    Bentley discovers that the magic football can transport him to different dimensions or time periods. The Cookie Man came over and I quickly said “Magic VANISH.” All of a sudden the magic disappeared... I then made a portal to a cookie dimension and gave it to the neighborhood... I thought why don't I change the date to Fall of 2025 when GTA 6 will be released... I then clicked TIME TRAVEL and downloaded the game... <em>END OF CHAPTER 16</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 17 — THE SPACE QUEST (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    I was going to wish for a giant pool of cheese, Suddenly Zack called. He said “There was a shortage of Magic.” I replied, “What do you mean?” ... I repaired a glowing satellite that had a device called a blocker and the signal was damaged. I repaired it and magic was restored. <em>END OF CHAPTER 17</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 18 — MAGIC NO LONGER (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    It was a normal day I turned on the TV, and suddenly the TV said “BREAKING NEWS.” The mayor declared magic is now illegal again... I then got in my car and drove back home and wished... <em>END OF CHAPTER 18</em>
  </p>
          <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 19 — THE WISH (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    I wished, “I wish I was the president.” The football replied, “I’m Sorry Master…” I replied, “What do you mean?” I called Zack. I dialed 555-zack and he said, “Hey, I'm sorry — you can't wish for such things. You would need to get voted next election.” The phone ends.  
    I then waited till the next election — it looked like it was Trump and Harris. I then entered the voting and said in an ad campaign, “Vote for ME! I will make all rights legal. I will make stuff right.”  
    I wished my ad everywhere and it did. I then won. After I won, I drafted a law: “NO ONE MAY BREAK THIS, OR CHANGE THIS — FREEDOM, RIGHTS, AND BELIEFS FOR ALL.”  
    <em>THE END OF CHAPTER 19</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 20 — THE UNKNOWN CALL (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    It was the first of December and it also seemed fine when suddenly I got a call from an “Unknown caller.” I thought to myself should I pick up this anonymous call — it's kinda suspicious.  
    My curiosity made me pick it up.  
    Operator: “Collect Call From Japan.”  
    I asked who is calling.  
    Operator: “I’m sorry, they wanted to remain anonymous.”  
    I accepted the call and they said, “あなたの魔法は危険にさらされています 雪が塔をブロックしています” (Your magic is in danger. Snow is blocking the tower).  
    I was confused — I didn't speak Japanese. Suddenly, the phone line ended.  
    I tried to use my magic to find out who it was — the magic ball used its speaker and on the screen of the football it said:  
    “KNSXE5TFOIXEE3DPMNVS4RLSOJ…”  
    I noticed it was Base64.  
    <em>END OF CHAPTER 20</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CHAPTER 21 — TRANSLATE (Made by Bentley)</strong><br>
    I translated the code from before — it was translated to:  
    “Server.Block.Error/(Internal/Error/Server Blocked)”  
    I saw this and thought, what was this error?  
    I was about to call Zack when the phone rang. The operator picked up and said, “Call from Zack. Additionally, you owe us $14,000 for the collect call from Japan.”  
    I then got transferred to 555-zack. Zack picks up and says, “Thanks for calling 555-zack — oh, it's Bentley! How can I help you?”  
    I reply, “I got a call from Japan saying あなたの魔法は危険にさらされて... what does this mean?”  
    Zack replies, “Hmm... I see the main signal is blocked. Our magic signal at Latitude: 100.9839832, Longitude: 172.091202 is blocked by snow and some device add-on.”  
    I replied, “What device add-on?”  
    Zack replies, “The device is snow-proof.”  
    As Zack goes to that satellite, he turns the magic on again.

        <h2>The Magic Guy Made By Bentley</h2>
        <p><strong>I woke up and immediately thought, "Where am I?" This wasn't my home. Then, I saw a man who said, "I will give you superpowers."</strong></p>
        <p>I screamed, "I don't care! Let me go!" The man clicked some buttons on a strange device, and suddenly, I was transported home. I woke up in a familiar place, but it seemed somehow different. But what was different?</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a scientist appeared and said, “Let's run some tests.” Suddenly, I blacked out, and I woke up in an operating room in a bed and for some reason I couldn't move. I yelled, “What's going on!?”</p>
        <p>The strange scientist appeared, and he had a syringe with a green ooze. All of a sudden, he gave me a shot from the syringe, and I suddenly found myself in a hospital room, and some doctors said, “Oh thank God you’re okay; we thought we lost you.” I replied, “What happened to me?”</p>
        <p>One of the doctors said, “You have been in a coma for the past three weeks, and according to our research, a rare animal bit you. The animal doesn't have any data in our database.”</p>
        <p>Another doctor asked, “Are you okay?”</p>
        <p>I shook my head. “I don't remember what happened; I had the best memory.”</p>
        <p>The first doctor said, “You’re being discharged; please call us at 800-555-HELP if anything comes up.”</p>
        <p>I got up and stretched my arms. My hand pointed at a box of tissues; it started to float. I screamed, “I have Telekinesis!”</p>
        <p>The doctors gasped in amazement, “You have superpowers! Wow, if that's a side effect we’ll have to keep a super close eye on you.”</p>
        <p>I walked toward the door, tried to close it, and reached for the handle. When I pulled the handle, it suddenly snapped off. “YOU HAVE SUPERSTRENGTH?”, they exclaimed. I then apologized for breaking their door, and they asked, "Can we get an autograph?"</p>

        <h3>The First Crime - Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>I went home, suddenly I heard a scream out the window, “HELP!! That guy stole my purse”.</p>
        <p>I go into superhero mode, I jump into action and I run down the stairs at full speed. I saw the guy who stole the purse, I saw him and said, “Hey you stop freeze drop the bag or I'll punch you” He continued to run I ran after him and punched him in the jaw and he screamed, ”OWWW! My Jaw! Call an ambulance” I take him to jail and he gets medical help. I then gave the woman her purse and she said, “Who are you?” I replied I’m. “Epic-Man”. I then go back to my house and I think to myself all superheroes have a suit. I call my good friend Zack… To Be Continued</p>

        <h3>Creating My SuperSuit - Chapter 2</h3>
        <p>I called 555-ZACK, and Zack answered my call quickly. He said, “Hey, it’s Zack The Wizard.” I replied, “Hey Zack, I needed a super suit.” Zack responded, “I’m a Wizard; I can do anything.” I asked, “Are you sure?” Zack replied, “Hey, I once made a magic football that granted wishes; I can do anything.” I told Zack, “I trusted you.” I drove over to Zack’s house and saw he had a bunch of weird tools and a can of soda. He gave me the soda and said, “Drink up.” I drank the soda, and suddenly a suit appeared, and I was disguised. Then Zack said, “See, I told you I can do anything.” I asked, “Hey Zack, can you make me a base?” Zack got a football and said, “Magic Football, give Bentley a base.” Suddenly, on my phone, I received a text from an anonymous number with an address. To Be Continued</p>

        <h3>Checking Out The Base - Chapter 3</h3>
        <p>I went to the location 32 Hero Drive. I saw that to even get into the base, there were security cameras, security guards, and security barbed wire around the walls of the building. I pulled up to the gate, and a security guard said, “Hey Buddy, I need to see I.D.” I replied, “Sure, I guess.” I handed the guy my ID; he looked at it, pulled out a phone, and then scanned the I.D. He said, “Let me check if you are permitted to enter.” I waited for him, and he said, “Come on in, Mr. Epic Man Sir.” I pulled my car through the gate as he opened it, and I saw a building that had on the ground, “We Solve Crimes.” I then entered the building, but the door was locked; it said to please scan your ID badge. I thought, what ID badge? I didn’t get one. Suddenly, another security guy pulled up and gave me an ID. He said, “Don’t lose it.” I then tapped the ID he gave me, and the building door opened. I was shocked with amazement; the building had a kitchen with a chef, a bunch of security measures, and a lot of screens that had access to a website where people filed reports, as well as a phone line at 555-0901, which could also be reached at 111. I was amazed, and I called up Zack and thanked him.</p>

        <h3>Solving Crime - Chapter 4</h3>
        <p>I was in my office when I received a call from 555-0978 and picked up. “Hello, is this the superhero hotline?” said 555-0978. I replied, “Yes, do you have an emergency?” She responded, “I’m reporting a suspicious person wearing all black who went into the bank with a weapon.” I asked, “Can you get me a license plate?” The caller replied, “Yeah, um, it's Crime01.” I said, “Yeah, I’ll be there in about three minutes.” The call ended, and I arrived at the bank to see the car with the license plate Crime01. I entered the bank and spotted a guy in a black ski mask. I noticed a vase and thought to myself, let’s have some fun with this one. The guy said, “First name Robin, last name DeBank.” I made the vase levitate and struck the guy with it. Suddenly, the news van showed up, and I got interviewed. They asked how I defeated the bad guy, and I demonstrated using another prop vase, performing the same action on the TV reporter, making sure it didn’t hurt him.</p>

        <h3>More Powers - Chapter 5</h3>
        <p>I wanted to be able to fly and to become invisible and to shapeshift. So, What did I do you might ask? I called up my good friend Zack the wizard he says, “I can upgrade your suit though it could be dangerous”, I then replied, “Just Do It” Zack Replies, “Come to my lab”, I go to his lab he says,”After this you’ll need to go to magic school which is in a different reality I can open a portal”. He Upgrades The Suit and Opens The Portal</p>

        <h3>Going To Magic School - Chapter 6</h3>
        <p>Zack opened the portal it was a green circular shape in a frame I go through the portal I’m in a school a robot flies towards me and says, “Please put on your uniform” I drink a soda and I’m in my suit the robot says, “Get to class loser”, I go to class and they said, “flying is the first thing to learn to start jump and click the up arrow in your suit you should be able to fly with the joystick” I learned this skill then I went to the next class the teacher said, “Alright in this class we will learn how to become invisible” I then paid attention very well more than usual and the teacher said to become invisible say hey A.I.S. (Artificial intelligent suit) turn on invisible mode.” I said hey A.I.S. Turn on invisible mode suddenly the teacher said, “Good Work Now Say A.I.S. Turn off invisible”. I then go to the next class shapeshifting the teacher says, “Hey Class To Shapeshift into anyone or any thing first scan an item into your suit next on your screen click manager on that item and click shapeshift.</p>
<p>Chapter 7: The Issue</p>
<p>I was only 16 I got 20 calls a day from the school saying I wasn't going to graduate because I didn't have enough credits as I was never at school. I then call Zack, “Hey Zack I need a robot that looks like me and sound and acts like me”, Zack replies, “Why would you need this”, I reply back, “School Keeps Calling I need a robot to go so I can graduate.”</p>
<p>Zack replies, “Well this time I need you to go on a quest to a old old lab that has a machine that clones humans to robot in my old factory at 214 Main Street. I run to 214 main street and I grab a device thats labled human cloner and modify it so I can drive it back. I drove it back and then zack cloned me.”</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Cloning Part 1</h2>
<p>I bring back the machine to Zack Zack replies, “SO it's gonna be a few days your gonna neeed to go to school till then.” I replied, “What about the cri-” Suddenly Zack interrupted, “The crime you were gonna say don't worry I can handle it.” I agreed with Zack to go to school.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: Going to School Part 1</h2>
<p>This chapter is based on true events. I was in English class, and I saw this girl I instantly thought omg she’s hot. I tried talking to her she was so shy. I tried to talk to her but I was shy as well which was strange as I'm never shy. I wrote a note saying my number and then we had a field trip after the field trip she texted me. I didnt read it till later I read, “Hi this is censored” and I replied did you text me at school she replied yeah sorry I texted at school I replied it's fine I went on about something random and she didnt text me. Later That Week I was told it wasn't her and I texted with another number and she said this was not her then said she would call the cops if I kept texting. Today we talked normally so I dont thing that was her.</p>
<h2> Chapter 10 A Shocking Twist</h2>
<p>I wanted to get more info I new it wasnt my crush I went on my tablet and downloaded an app to text “My Crush” I text her hi is this [CENSORED] later she replies oh god leave me alone I replied is this [Redacted] she replies,”Yea and Bentley has been having all his friends text me bc I pretended to be [CENSORED] bc she didnt want him having her number bc he is a creepy weirdo” I then felt very sad and cried inside later, “I'm not [Censor] and she like hates your guts anyways…And she will never date you so get that in ur head’. This Chapter Does Not Have Names As The People Asked Not To Mention Their Name</p>
<h3>Chapter 11 Magic Eraser</h3>
<p>It was time school was over I went to my secret base there was a package from Zack’s Magic Factory To Bentley The Superhero I opened the package asuming it was nothing as it got past security. I open it it's an eraser that glowed I said what the heck is this then I see a piece of paper that says, “This is Zack I have sent you a magic eraser to use if a bad guy is near use the eraser it teleports them to jail.”, I look at the eraser and say this a weird looking eraser suddenly the emergency alarm goes off I drink a soda and transform now I go to action and I find the criminal they run so fast but I chuck a eraser at them the suddenly vanish and I get a call from the police station saying a criminal magically appeared </p>
<h1>The I.T. Guy</h1>  
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>  

<p>I was in my superhero headquarters when suddenly, a message flashed on the main computer screen, displaying an urgent warning: <strong>"HACKED!! Base is on lockdown!"</strong></p>  

<p>Instantly, all the digital clocks switched to a special mode, their screens now reading: <strong>"Lockdown!"</strong></p>  

<p>My phone rang, and Zack’s voice came through the automated message:  
<em>"Hey, it's Zack. This is an automated message. If you're hearing this, the building is on lockdown, and all exits are sealed. If you're in your office, rewire the clock 24 hours forward, and the lockdown will lift. If you're not in your office... well, you're out of luck."</em></p>  

<p>The call ended. I rushed to my office door, but it was locked. Thinking fast, I grabbed a coat hanger and straightened it out. Carefully, I slid it under the door, hooked it around the handle, and pulled. The door clicked open.</p>  

<p>Glancing around, I searched for a clock. I found one hidden inside a cabinet. Wasting no time, I rewired it to move forward by 24 hours.</p>  

<p>Suddenly, all the clocks in the building flashed: <strong>"Lockdown Over!"</strong></p>

  <h1>The Science Lab</h1>
  <h2>By Bentley Playz</h2>

  <h3>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h3>
  <p>
    It was a bright Tuesday morning, and the sun was shining. I was in my lab, hidden inside my house through a secret entrance. Suddenly, one of the scientists in the lab spoke to me — the guy with the tag that said “BOB.” Bob said, “Hey— boss we made a device that can open a portal.” I asked, “What The Portal To? Where does it go?” Bob told me, “According to the infinite universe paradox there are infinite worlds and we found a gate into it.” I responded to Bob, “Bob what does this mean?” Bob replied, “Well, we can go to the universe that has SpongeBob, or an opposite universe, or the ‘The Magic Football’ Universe.” I replied, “How is this possible?” 
    Another scientist called “Gregory” came up and Greg said, “Boss the portal is taking too much power—it’s going to blow.” I quickly replied, “Bob, shut down the portal now.” Bob immediately went into action, typing furiously. He said, “I can shut it down, but we’re going to blackout the city.” Greg replied, “Let me check—we got 60 seconds. Bob, shut it down or we’re dead.” 
    I replied, “Bob, move out of the way—I have the shutdown code.” I immediately went to the computer and clicked “EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN.” The computer said “Enter code,” and then Greg interrupted, “Quick—20 seconds.” I immediately typed 0012847 then ENTER, and then a popup appeared: “PORTAL SHUTDOWN.” 
    Suddenly an emergency broadcast came on the monitor after a minute when the power came back on: “This is Sarah with the 5 o’clock news. Live power outage after a huge amount of power was being taken into an unknown location. The FBI is on the line tracing the location as we speak.” I immediately panicked and went on the intercom: “Attention everyone, at this time the lab is being shut down until further notice. Thank you — Bentley.”
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 1</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 2: FBI Investigation</h3>
  <p>
    I went to my kitchen to make macaroni and cheese and heard a knock: “FBI, open up.” I opened the door and saw ten officers and a news team. I asked, “May I help you?” The FBI agent replied softly, “I have reason to believe you caused a blackout. Do you mind if we search?” I replied, “Do you have a warrant?” They said, “Yes, we have a search warrant.” I replied, “Alright then, feel free to search.” Their team searched every nook and cranny—the bedroom, the bathroom, the kitchen, my bedroom. Then the agents came back to the front. “Alright, so sorry to waste your time.” Then the team and the news left.
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 2</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 3: Lab Recovery</h3>
  <p>
    I went back to my lab after calling the scientists down. I found Bob and asked him, “Is there a way we can stabilize the portal? We used way too much power and almost got caught.” Bob replied softly, “Yeah, I can attempt to edit the power usage or use a generator — which would you like me to do?” I replied, “Let’s use a generator to stabilize the power usage. Also, is the portal even safe?” Fred, the electronics guy, came to fix the power usage. He brought a soldering gun and soldered a new electronic power stabilizer. Then he said, “Yeah, the portal is as stabilized as possible—you’re all clear to use it.”
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 3</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 4: The Portal</h3>
  <p>
    I turned on the portal and set it to the “Gold World.” Bob said, “Wait!”—then he had a flashback, remembering that his pet dog had been kidnapped by someone who opened a portal using a device and disappeared. Bob said, “Here, take this radio in case the portal closes. The radio has advanced technology that makes it work in any universe.” I took and equipped the radio and then hopped into the portal. Suddenly, the entire world was gold. I piled gold into my bag and found my house—it was the same but richer. After an hour, the radio went off: “You got 2 minutes—the portal is getting unstable. I may not be able to reopen the portal. Hello, do you copy?” I replied, “I have traveled quite a bit—I’m unsure where the portal is.” I received an instant reply, “Click the find button on the radio, then click portal.” The radio spoke, “Head north 20 feet, then head west 5 feet.” I followed the directions, found the golden portal, and hopped back in. Bob said, “Alright, the portal needs to recharge for about an hour.” I asked, “So why did you make this—what’s the point?” Bob replied sadly, “My dog. They took my dog—someone using a portal took my dog…” I replied, “We will find them and bring your dog back at all cost.”
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 4</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 5: Bob’s Dog</h3>
  <p>
    I asked the greatest scientist ever, “Jerry,” “How can we trace which universe took Bob’s dog?” Jerry replied, “Do we have DNA from the dog? I can make an add-on to the portal that searches the universes to find the dog.” Jerry started working—building a metal box, adding wiring and supports to the portal. Two hours later, Jerry finished the add-on and plugged it in. I found Bob and asked for DNA. He gave me a piece of hair, which I placed in the tray. After 20 minutes, the locator found a universe—the “Criminal Verse.” I got equipment from Bob. He warned, “It may be dangerous. I have equipment for this mission.” He handed me an upgraded radio with gravity control, backup calls, and equipment drop-offs. Also, he gave me an invulnerable sword. I hesitated; we only had 1 hour and 2 minutes. Jerry came and made a dial add-on to extend time and shut down the portal. “Alright, you’re all set,” Jerry said.
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 5</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 6: Recovering the Dog</h3>
  <p>
    I hopped into the portal and saw a disturbing old world—a worn-down road. A local said, “Who the heck are you? I ain’t ever seen you around here. Where you come from?” I replied, “I’m not looking for trouble—I’m new around here.” I walked away and went on the radio, “Beep boop… Hello, does anyone copy?” I heard alien-like replies and realized I was on the wrong channel. I switched and repeated my question. Jerry replied, “Hit the GPS button—it’ll lead you there.” I hit the button labeled “GPS.” It said, “Head left 2 miles, then go forward 1.5 miles.” I followed the instructions and reached a sketchy house, abandoned for 20 years with broken windows. I knocked, and someone answered: “Hello, how can I help you?” I replied, “I’m from a different universe—I came to retrieve my friend’s dog.” The guy said, “You mean Fido? I got him 3 years ago from an Earth dimension. I thought he was mine—sorry, take your dog back.” I took the dog and returned to give him back to Bob.

     <h1>A Scary Halloween!</h1>
  <h2>By Bentley Playz</h2>
<h3>INTRO</h3>
  <p>
    It was a dark night on one Halloween night and I go to one door to the next.
    I go to a blue house, I knock and hear a voice, “Hello Student Bentley.”
    I reply, “TRICK OR TREAT.” Mr. Bevins gives me a full-size candy bar and says,
    “BEWARE of the scary mansion that is storied to be haunted.”
    I then go to another house and overhear some kids, “I hear the scary mansion has 10 LBS bags of candy.”
    I then run up to the Mansion. I go to ring the doorbell — <em>DiNg DoNg!</em>
    I hear a creepy voice in a creepy tone, “Come in.”
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF INTRO</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 1: Entering The Scary House</h3>
  <p>
    I open the door to the scary mansion. I hear the door creak as I go inside and see the house looks abandoned.
    I yell, “Hello?” but hear no response. I see a door on my left and enter it, finding a small room with a bed
    that has new-looking sheets, so I think someone lives here. I enter the next room through a worn-down door.
    Suddenly, the floor bursts — it was a trap! I fall about 40 feet and land on a bed mattress, which breaks my fall.
    I look around and realize I’m in an abandoned chocolate factory.
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 1</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 2: Exploring the Chocolate Factory</h3>
  <p>
    I look around and see tons of machines still working to make chocolate. I grab my trick-or-treat bag and fill it
    with around 10 LBS of Skittles and 10 LBS of Hershey’s bars — and even more! I search for a way out and find a staircase.
    I take it and end up back in the main room. I go into another room upstairs in the mansion — and then I see a guy who
    stabs me…
  </p>
  <p><strong>END OF CHAPTER 2</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter 3: The End</h3>
  <p>
    I wake up an hour later and hear familiar voices — it’s Mr. Bevins, Ms. Angie, and my good friends Syd and Gracie.
    They’re in my bedroom. “Are you okay? You were screaming,” they said. “What happened?” I asked.
    They all replied, “Bentley, you have been asleep for the past 3 hours.”
